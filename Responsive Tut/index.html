                <p class="txtsmall">This is a website I created to learn how to make responsive websites. Responsive websites are really cool, they change shape to better fit the device you are using to access them. Its like a shape shifting website
                    It is not as hard to do as it seems, its quiet simple actually.

            <p class="txtbig" style="font-weight:bold;">Why make this website?</p>
            <p class="txtsmall" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Making the website is the best and fastest way of getting a good understanding as well as a practice of the topic, it helps in better understanding the process as compared to just reading.
                To be honest I have no idea what I am writing, I just need to fill some lines to test the website out so I am writing anything that comes to my mind, also its a good typing practice to do every once in a while.
                While we are on the topic of typing, I have been trying to learn touch typing for a while now but I find it very difficult to master, I have seen that I have a far supirior muscle memory of typing with just 4 fingers and 
                I can achieve speeds of around 45-50 wpm by typing with 4 fingers alone, so I am confused, should I invest more time practicing touch typing or should I keep using four fingers and Invest the time in aquiring other skills?
                If you have any suggestions for me , feel free to dm me on twitter/instagram/linkedin , you can check out my other projects on github.com/siddharhabhattacharjee , its not a lot at the moment but its all I have done so far to 
                improve my self and to be a great programmer. If you are still reading my bs, you are amazing, I hope you have an amazing day, Thanks for reading.
